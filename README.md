# Fran Camargo - Exploring the Intersection Between Technology, Art, and Writing 💻🎨📚

**Hello there, welcome!**  
I’m **Fran Camargo**, someone who has always followed curiosity and the desire to learn. My journey is a blend of technology, art, and writing—three passions that have shaped who I am and what I do.

### 👩‍💻 Technology: Where It All Began  
I was studying **Systems Analysis and Development** when life presented me with an unexpected opportunity: a scholarship offer and a job promotion. I decided to pause my studies in the fourth semester to graduate in **International Trade** and embrace this chance. But the call of technology has always been with me, and now I’m focused on returning to this world, studying **Java**, while already having some knowledge in **Python, C#**, and **HTML5/CSS**.

### 📚 Passion for Writing  
Between codes and projects, I discovered another passion: writing. I have **over 30 published books**, both digital and physical, where I share reflections on personal development, management, and a bit of everything I’ve learned throughout life. Writing feels like a conversation, and each book I create is a chance to inspire someone.

### 🎨 Creativity in Motion  
Digital art is also part of my journey. I create and sell **over 130 digital artworks** in galleries across Brazil. For me, art is a form of expression that complements everything I do, whether in code or writing.

### 🌍 Three Languages, Many Worlds  
I speak **Portuguese**, **English**, and **Spanish**, which helps me explore ideas and collaborate with people from different parts of the world. Whether through code, a work of art, or a text, I love discovering new ways to communicate and learn.

### 🔗 Shall We Chat?  
Do you like technology, art, or good conversations? Let’s exchange ideas! I’m always open to new projects and collaborations. 😊
