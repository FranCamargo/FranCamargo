  <h1>👋 Hello there, welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Fran Camargo</strong>, a curious learner driven by a love for <span style="color:#1e90ff;">technology</span>, <span style="color:#ff6347;">art</span>, and <span style="color:#32cd32;">writing</span>. My journey in tech started in 2017 studying <strong>Systems Analysis and Development</strong>, but paused my studies to pursue a scholarship and job promotion in <strong>Foreign Trade<strong> in 2019. I’m back in tech now, diving deep into <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>. I already have knowledge in  <strong> JavaScript, Python, C#, and HTML/CSS</strong> and also speak <strong>Portuguese</strong>, <strong>English</strong>, and <strong>Spanish</strong> what allows me to connect with people worldwide and embrace diverse perspectives.
  </p>

<p>
I am a person who loves to find new businesses and innovate, so you will probably find books and art that I have created somewhere on the internet one day.
I love to write and create art in my spare time, I have published more than <strong>30 books</strong> about personal development and management, hoping to inspire and empower others. And my digital art is also being presented in galleries throughout Brazil and printed on some products such as t-shirts, caps, mugs, books, decoration and more.
